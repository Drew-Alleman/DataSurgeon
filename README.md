# Recent Updates
# 5/25/2023 | 1.2.0
This update brings a plugin management system to DataSurgeon. You can now add, remove, and list plugins using the ````--add````, ````--remove````, and ````--list```` options.

I also added a new plugin, [ds-winreg-plugin](https://github.com/Drew-Alleman/ds-winreg-plugin/), that can find Windows registry paths.

To add a new plugin, use ````--add <URL>````, where the URL is a GitHub repository with a ````plugins.json```` file. To remove a plugin, use ````--remove <URL>````. To see all your plugins, use the ````--list```` option.

Once a plugin is added, you can use it as an argument in DataSurgeon. The argument's name is the "Argument Long Name" in the plugin's ````plugins.json```` file.
# Quick Install
The quick installer can also be used to update DataSurgeon. 

## Video Guide
[![Guide](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_Sq8Qgndi4M/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sq8Qgndi4M)

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Github](https://git-scm.com/downloads) then RESTART YOUR TERMINAL.

### Linux
```
read -p "Would you like to add 'ds' to your local bin? This will make 'ds' executable from any location in your terminal. (y/n) " response && wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drew-Alleman/DataSurgeon/main/install/install.sh | bash -s -- "$response"
```

### Windows 
Enter the line below in an elevated powershell window. 
```
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drew-Alleman/DataSurgeon/main/install/install.ps1")
```
Relaunch your terminal and you will be able to use ```ds``` from the command line.

### Mac
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drew-Alleman/DataSurgeon/main/install/install.sh | sh
```

# Examples
## Extracting Files From a Remote Webiste
Here I use ```wget``` to make a request to stackoverflow then I forward the body text to ```ds``` . The ```-F``` option will list all files found. ```--clean``` is used to remove any extra text that might have been returned (such as extra html). Then the result of is sent to ```uniq``` which removes any non unique files found. Ig you wanted you can remove the warning message at the top 'Reading standard input..' by using -S.
```
$ wget -qO - https://www.stackoverflow.com | ds -F --clean | uniq
```

## Extracting Mac Addresses From an Output File
Here I am pulling all mac addresses found in [autodeauth's](https://github.com/Drew-Alleman/autodeauth) log file using the ```-m``` query. The ```--hide``` option will hide the identifer string infront of the results. In this case 'mac_address: ' is hidden from the output. The ```-T``` option is used to check the same line multiple times for matches. Normallly when a match is found the tool moves on to the next line rather then checking again. 
```
$ ./ds -m -T --hide -f /var/log/autodeauth/log     
2023-02-26 00:28:19 - Sending 500 deauth frames to network: BC:2E:48:E5:DE:FF -- PrivateNetwork
2023-02-26 00:35:22 - Sending 500 deauth frames to network: 90:58:51:1C:C9:E1 -- TestNet
```

## Reading all files in a directory
You can use the ```--directory``` option to read all files in the specified directory recursively. The ```-D``` option is used to display the filename where the match was found. ```-l``` or ```--line``` is used to display the line number the content was found on.
```
$ ds --directory test_dir/ -Dl
```

## CSV Output
To output your results to a CSV file, use the ```-o``` option followed by the name of the file you want to save your data to. The ```-D``` and ```-X``` are supported. The format is: ```ds -o <FILENAME>.csv``` (.csv is needed). 
```
 $ wget -qO - https://www.stackoverflow.com | ds -o output.csv -C
```

# Speed Tests
When no specific query is provided, ```ds``` will search through all possible types of data, which is <b>SIGNIFICANTLY</b> slower than using individual queries. The slowest query is ```--files```. Its also slightly faster to use ```cat``` to pipe the data to ```ds```. 

Below is the elapsed time when processing a 5GB test file generated by [ds-test](https://github.com/Drew-Alleman/ds-test). Each test was ran 3 times and the average time was recorded.

### Computer Specs 
```
Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz, 2904 Mhz, 6 Core(s), 12 Logical Processor(s)
Ram         12.0 GB (11.9 GB usable)
```

## Searching all data types

Command         | Speed         
----------------|----------------
`cat test.txt \| ds -t` | 00h:02m:04s |
`ds -t -f test.txt` | 00h:02m:05s
`cat test.txt \| ds -t -o output.txt` | 00h:02m:06s

## Using specific queries

Command         | Speed          | Query Count
----------------|----------------|----------------
`cat test.txt \| ds -t -6` | 00h:00m:12s | 1
`cat test.txt \| ds -t -i -m` | 00h:00m:22 | 2
`cat test.txt \| ds -tF6c` | 00h:00m:32s | 3
